> How to use Scopus to create a corpus with the [Scopus Python SDK](https://github.com/ElsevierDev/elsapy)

This work is being developed as I learn to create a corpus which I will analyse as part of my dissertation. This not only includes details about how to use Scopus and ingest data, but also information about the extent and usefulness of Scopus as a service in comparison to alternatives including Google Scholar and Web of Science. 

01. [Access and Query Scopus](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nicole-brewer/corpus_creation_with_scopus/HEAD?labpath=01_Access_and_Query_Scopus.ipynb)
02. [Designing Search Queries](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nicole-brewer/corpus_creation_with_scopus/HEAD?labpath=02_Designing_Search_Queries.ipynb)



Development Goals:

- [x] Launch with Binder
- [ ] Create instructional Jupyter Book
